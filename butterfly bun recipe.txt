Butterfly buns recipe

Ingredients
100g (4oz) caster sugar
100g (4oz) butter, softened
2 large eggs
100g (4oz) self-raising flour
Â½ tsp baking powder
15ml (1tbsp) milk
50g (2oz) butter, softened
75g (3oz) icing sugar
2tbsp strawberry jam
Icing sugar, for dusting

Method
Preheat the oven to 190C, gas 5. Line a muffin tray with 10 paper muffin cases.

Place the sugar, butter, eggs, flour, baking powder and milk in a large bowl and mix with an electric whisk until pale and creamy.

Divide the mixture between the muffin cases and bake for 15-20 mins until risen, golden and firm to the touch. Transfer to a cooling rack. Leave to cool.

To make the buttercream, place the butter in a bowl and sift over the icing sugar. Beat until smooth.

Slice the tops off each cake and fill the cavities with a little buttercream and jam. Cut each sliced top in half and arrange on top of the filling to resemble butterfly wings. Dust lightly with icing sugar.

Top tip for making Butterfly buns
Swap the jam for something naughtier like peanut butter or chocolate spread.
